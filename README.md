# Lang-Compare

A simple project to compare the speed of different programming languages.

All code was generated by chatGPT (run.js has been heavily edited) as this is just a testing project, not a real project.

## What it does:

It generates every hex (#RRGGBB) color and measures the time it takes to generate them in each language. current languages are:

- Python
- JavaScript
- Ruby
- Rust
- Go
- Java

## Commands:

npm install:all - Installs all npm and cargo dependencies

npm compile:java - Compiles the Java code

node . - Runs all of the files

## Files:
`main.go` - Go gen code
`main.java` - Java gen code
`main.js` - JavaScript gen code
`main.py` - Python gen code
`main.rb` - Ruby gen code
`main.rs` - Rust gen code
`run.js` - Main file that runs all the other files
